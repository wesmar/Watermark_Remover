# Windows Watermark Remover

A lightweight Windows utility that removes the desktop watermark on evaluation and insider builds. Built with pure WinAPI and modern C++, resulting in minimal binary size approaching assembly-level optimization.

## Features

- **Removes Windows watermarks** from desktop background
- **Automatic Explorer restart** for immediate effect
- **TrustedInstaller integration** for system-level operations
- **Clean GUI interface** with real-time status display
- **Restore functionality** to revert changes
- **Minimal footprint** - optimized binary size using custom CRT replacement

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Modern C++ (stdcpplatest)
- **API**: Pure Windows API (no external frameworks)
- **Architecture**: DLL proxy injection + Import Address Table (IAT) patching
- **Build System**: VS 2022 or higher
- **Size Optimization**: Custom minimal CRT implementation

## How It Works

The tool operates through a sophisticated multi-layer approach:

1. **Proxy DLL Mechanism**: Creates `ExpIorerFrame.dll` (note the deliberate typo to avoid conflicts) that intercepts Windows Explorer calls
2. **IAT Patching**: Redirects `LoadString` and `ExtTextOut` API calls from `shell32.dll` to custom implementations
3. **Watermark Detection**: Analyzes text strings against known watermark patterns from Windows branding
4. **TrustedInstaller Execution**: Leverages Windows TrustedInstaller service for system-level file and registry modifications
5. **Registry Modification**: Updates CLSID registry entries to load the proxy DLL instead of the original

### Key Components

- **Explorerframe.cpp**: Proxy DLL with minimal CRT and API interception
- **TrustedInstallerExecutor**: Token impersonation and privilege escalation handler
- **ResourceExtractor**: Embedded DLL extraction from executable resources
- **IAT Patcher**: Import Address Table manipulation for function hooking

## Installation

### Download

Download the latest release: [SignGuiPatcher.zip](https://github.com/wesmar/Watermark_Remover/releases/download/v1.0.0-Watermark_Remover/SignGuiPatcher.zip)

## Usage

1. **Run SignGuiPatcher.exe as Administrator** (required for system modifications)
2. Click **"APPLY PATCH"** to remove the watermark
3. Explorer will restart automatically
4. Click **"RESTORE"** to revert to original state

### Status Indicators

- ðŸŸ¢ **WATERMARK REMOVED âœ“** - Patch successfully applied
- ðŸ”´ **WATERMARK ACTIVE âœ“** - Original state (watermark visible)
- âš« **UNKNOWN STATE** - Inconsistent system state

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (tested on latest builds 25H2 26200+)
- Administrator privileges
- x64 architecture

## Security Considerations

This tool requires elevated privileges and does not modify any system files. It:
- Uses TrustedInstaller service for legitimate system modifications
- Creates a proxy DLL in System32 directory
- Modifies COM object registration in the registry
- All changes are reversible via the "RESTORE" function
